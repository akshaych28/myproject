We're testing translated captions for this lecture

Are guys in this video we are going to initialize an empty get repository in our project folder.

So you see right here in my programs directory I have my project opened up in the terminal make sure

that you're in the proper directory in your terminal.

And if you open up my project you'll see I just have a text document that just has a bunch of random

filler text.

So you want to try to do in this video is initialize a get repository in this.

My project folder so that we can track all the additions deletions and changes that we make to everything

in this folder.

So in order to do that very very simple all we're going to do.

So open up our terminal make sure in your project folder and typing get in it which means get initialized

your initializing a repository in the selected folder.

So you see not says initialize get repository and this dot get folder shows up in our project directory.

OK so I'm going to delete that and then run get in it again and you'll see the doc get folder pop up

once again.

OK so this is great but notice how it says empty get repository meaning that we haven't actually added

anything to the repository.

We have not added the text that takes the document inside the get repository.

So one thing that you're going to have to check is you're going to want to open up your terminal and

you're going to want to type in get status.

And what this command is going to let you do is it's going to show you what you have it actually saved

to the repository.

OK.

So when I press enter on this you see untracked files tech start takes s.

We have not added that to the get repository.

So we have to add it and then committed to the get repository in order for it to officially be saved.

And that is what we are going to be going over and the next video.

So you guys so much for watching this and I hope to see you then.
